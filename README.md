# Aesthetic Clock made with P5.js 

An example of a simple, modern clock which can be made in P5.js.<br />
The clock should be able to scale to small screens, and can also be used with Electron. <br />
<br />
**Click anywhere on the screen to switch between digital and analog**<br />
<br />
**NOTE:** run `npm install electron@latest` inside the 'electron-version' directory to install dependencies, then use `electron .` to run the application<br />
